## Simplified Notion Application
- For my Final Project in the Cs50 2022 Course I plan to emulate a web application similar to Notion, a famous app that, together with Evernote and others, serves as a notebook of sorts for organization and productivity. You will be able to take notes, set timers, to some extent change and customize your experience with the website, create todo lists and tables, upload images and have a daily water intake counter. The site will also emulate a team experience with a login and register pages, where you can input teams you are part of and change each others pages.
